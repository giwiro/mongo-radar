Multithread python3 script that scans and do some operations over provided ips, and looks for default mongodb 
unauthorized access, through Tor sock4 proxy using proxychains and writes it into a log file.

There are tons of mongo databases without any type of authentication out there in the wild;
a lot of them [get hacked](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QonE9oeMOQHVh8heFIyeqrjfKEViL0poLnY8mAakKhM/edit#gid=1781677175),
that's why we should be really careful when configuring the Database.

Just **for research purposes** I developed an automated tool to discover, dumps and symmetric encrypt all the collections
in the discovered mongodb list. 
In order to stay anonymous we use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) service running as a SOCK4 proxy,
and [proxychains](http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/) to capture all tcp requests made by `mongo-radar`
and proxy them to the Tor SOCK4 port. 

## Usage

```
./mongo-radar [-h] [--out INPUT_OUT] [--ips INPUT_IPS]
                   [--workers INPUT_W] [--dump] [--kidnap INPUT_ACCOUNT]
                   
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --out INPUT_OUT       Define the ouput folder location.
  --ips INPUT_IPS       Define list of ips or range of ips to scan. Ex:
                        127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2-255
  --workers INPUT_WORKERS
                        Define the number of worker threads (> 4) that will be
                        doing the jobs simultaneously.
  --dump                Dumps all the databases found and saves it into out
                        directory.

- proxychains installed (binary `proxychains4` on path)
- python 3
- pipenv
- make
- mongodump (provided in the package `mongo-tools`)


## Install
Run the `install` goal
```
make install
```

## Run
First give execution privileges
